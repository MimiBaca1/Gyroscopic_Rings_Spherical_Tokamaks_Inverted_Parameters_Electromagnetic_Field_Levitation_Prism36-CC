# Prism36: A Theoretical Framework for Electromagnetic Field Stabilization

## Overview
This repository presents a theoretical framework focused on spherical tokamak stabilization using gyroscopic ring dynamics and field-induced plasma suspension. Central to the model is **Prism36**, a 36-node harmonic shell enabling spatial inversion and energy containment.

## Key Concepts
- **Spherical Tokamaks**: Compact fusion reactors with enhanced confinement geometry.
- **Gyroscopic Rings**: Rotational stabilization structures influencing plasma equilibrium.
- **Field-Induced Suspension**: Electromagnetic levitation and containment of plasma.
- **Prism36 Geometry**: A multidimensional harmonic lattice for spatial inversion.
- **Crystal Infusion**: Integration of crystalline structures to enhance field coherence.
- **Titanium-Steel Alloy 6246**: High-tensile material for magnetic and thermal resilience.
