# Gyroscopic_Rings_Spherical_Tokamaks_Inverted_Parameters_Electromagnetic_Field_Levitation_Prism36-CC
 A theoretical framework exploring spherical tokamak architecture with gyroscopic ring dynamics, field-induced stabilization, and plasma suspension. Central to the model is Prism36—a 36-node harmonic shell enabling spatial inversion and energy containment—augmented by crystal infusion techniques and a titanium-steel alloy 6246 matrix for structure
