Revised Theory
## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository presents a theoretical framework focused on spherical tokamak stabilization using gyroscopic ring dynamics and field-induced plasma suspension. Central to the model is **Prism36**, a 36-node harmonic shell enabling spatial inversion and energy containment.

Inspired by Faraday cage principles, the tokamak's outer shell is envisioned as a **titanium-steel alloy 6246 lattice**, designed to shield and modulate electromagnetic fields while withstanding extreme thermal loads. At the core lies **Prism36**, a crystal-infused polyhedral structure that functions either as a containment stabilizer or an energy focal nodeâ€”similar to nonlinear optics in laser systems.

The architecture explores dual-mode operation: one for plasma equilibrium and another for energy concentration, with gyroscopic rings providing dynamic stabilization across equatorial and polar planes.

## ðŸ§© Architecture Summary

- **Faraday-Inspired Lattice Shell**: A titanium-steel alloy 6246 sphere forms a harmonic lattice that shields and shapes electromagnetic fields.
- **Prism36 Core**: A crystal-infused polyhedral structure acting as either a containment stabilizer or energy node, depending on operational mode.
- **Gyroscopic Rings**: Rotational stabilizers orbiting the shell to counteract plasma drift and maintain equilibrium.
- **Dual-Mode Operation**:
  - *Containment Mode*: Prism36 harmonizes field geometry for plasma suspension.
  - *Energy Node Mode*: Prism36 concentrates and redistributes energy flows, akin to laser optics.
